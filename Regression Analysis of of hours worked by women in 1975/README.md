In this project, I conducted regression analysis, interpreting coefficients with significance tests, making predictions with confidence intervals. Employed dummy variables and tested equality of coefficients. Utilized J-test and RESET specification test. Discussed measurement errors and proxy variables' effects. Applied Cook's distance for outlier detection and conducted hypothesis testing.
